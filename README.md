## Epileptic Seizure Detection Through Machine Learning Classification of Heart Rate Variability Features

- Worked under Dr. Vasiliki Ikonomidou as a part of the Aspiring Scientists' Summer Internship Program (ASSIP '20).
- Used Support-Vector Machine classifiers in Machine-Learning models to detect Epileptic-seizures based on Heart-Rate Variability trends in Medical (ECG) data gathered from the Physiobank Automated Teller Machine.
- Pending publication in "Journal of Student-Scientistsâ€™" research journal.
